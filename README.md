# Paw **Fatale**

### Project #1

This game objective was to gain more experience working with Object Oriented Programming and with the HTML Canvas tag. My other technical capabilities as a programmer were used. Making this project helped me a lot on improving my skills and to gain a more practical way of making things happen :+1:.

Idea behind the game:

My vision of the game was inspired by a sweet and ferocious little cat named "Amélia". She's been in my life for several months now and sometimes i wonder how i managed to survive such horrendous attacks :adhesive_bandage:

Although she can be a really adorable and beautiful lady cat, she can also turn to a giant ass%"#% and attack you while you sleep.

How it was made:

- Javascript to make the logic part of the game :robot:,
- HTML for the main structure of the webpage :man_mechanic:,
- CSS to put some "glitter" on it :sunglasses:
